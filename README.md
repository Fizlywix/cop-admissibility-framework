# cop-admissibility-framework
A collection of formal papers defining Constraint-Oriented Programming (COP): an admissibility framework for system interactions. The corpus is split into Light papers (L1–L8) specifying structure and use, and Shadow papers (S1–S8) mapping unavoidable paradoxes and limits. COP forbids illegitimate inference rather than explaining behavior.
