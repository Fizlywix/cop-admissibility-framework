\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
This document lists non-canonical paradox anchors that commonly precede the COP framework.
These anchors are not COP entries and do not constrain admissibility.
They exist only to provide recognition points for readers.
They must not be used for derivation or interpretation.
\end{abstract}

\section{Status and Role}

This document is \textbf{not} canonical.
It is a source layer.

Known paradox anchors:
\begin{itemize}
  \item do not define admissibility,
  \item do not override any COP section,
  \item and must not be treated as equivalent to COP entries.
\end{itemize}

\section{Source Anchors by Shadow Axis}

The anchors below are arranged to match the Shadow Axes structure.
Similarity does not imply identity.

\subsection*{A1 (S1) — Loss Required for Continuation}
\textbf{Related Shadow Axis:} S1 (COP-01 ↔ COP-02)

Common pre-COP recognition:
loss, discard, pruning, or sacrifice is required to prevent collapse.

\subsection*{A2 (S2) — Contradictions That Must Be Routed}
\textbf{Related Shadow Axis:} S2 (COP-03 ↔ COP-06)

Common pre-COP recognition:
incompatibilities persist without resolution; outcomes do not justify causal stories.

\subsection*{A3 (S3) — Coherence Without Signaling; Maintenance Without Origin}
\textbf{Related Shadow Axis:} S3 (COP-04 ↔ COP-11)

Common pre-COP recognition:
systems stay aligned without communication; upkeep repeats without revealing beginnings.

\subsection*{A4 (S4) — Operation Within Bands; Responsibility Diffuses}
\textbf{Related Shadow Axis:} S4 (COP-05 ↔ COP-13)

Common pre-COP recognition:
stability is range-bound; systemic impact cannot be assigned to single actors.

\subsection*{A5 (S5) — One Frame, Many Functions; Agency Is Situational}
\textbf{Related Shadow Axis:} S5 (COP-07 ↔ COP-09)

Common pre-COP recognition:
unity does not imply sameness; agency emerges only under enabling conditions.

\subsection*{A6 (S6) — Binding Without Agreement; Not All Actions Count}
\textbf{Related Shadow Axis:} S6 (COP-08 ↔ COP-10)

Common pre-COP recognition:
commitment can stabilize without consensus; motion without consequence is null.

\subsection*{A7 (S7) — Coordination Without Fusion; Limits Are Health}
\textbf{Related Shadow Axis:} S7 (COP-12 ↔ COP-14)

Common pre-COP recognition:
integration beyond limits produces brittleness; constraints preserve viability.

\subsection*{A8 (S8) — Invisibility of What Works; Background Must Not Become Actor}
\textbf{Related Shadow Axis:} S8 (COP-00 ↔ COP-15)

Common pre-COP recognition:
what functions correctly disappears; infrastructure should not enter the foreground.

\section{Non-Equivalence Rule}

No anchor listed here:
\begin{itemize}
  \item is a COP entry,
  \item substitutes for a COP,
  \item or licenses interpretation of a COP.
\end{itemize}

\section{Use}

Permitted use:
\begin{itemize}
  \item orientation,
  \item teaching,
  \item translation for unfamiliar audiences.
\end{itemize}

Forbidden use:
\begin{itemize}
  \item derivation of COP structure,
  \item explanation of COP meaning,
  \item justification of interventions.
\end{itemize}
