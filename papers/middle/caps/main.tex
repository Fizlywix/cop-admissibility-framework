\title{Caps: Structural Boundary Conditions in the COP Framework}
\author{Pascal Sparidaens}

\begin{document}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
This document specifies the Caps of the COP framework.
Caps define structural boundary conditions.
They are not operating paradoxes and do not participate in admissible operation.
Their sole purpose is to bound the framework before and after use.
\end{abstract}

\section{Status and Role}

This document is not explanatory.
It is delimiting.

Caps:
\begin{itemize}
  \item are not part of the operating paradox set,
  \item are not traversable,
  \item are not resolvable,
  \item and are not subject to interpretation.
\end{itemize}

Caps define where the framework begins and where it must stop.

\section{Caps}

The COP framework contains exactly two Caps.

\subsection*{COP-00 — Null Dominance \hfill (RI)}

Null Dominance constrains admissibility before any structure appears.

Operationally:
\begin{itemize}
  \item correct operation leaves no trace,
  \item absence of signal is admissible,
  \item visibility does not imply importance.
\end{itemize}

COP-00 forbids foregrounding what functions correctly.

\subsection*{COP-15 — Background Operation \hfill (RI)}

Background Operation constrains admissibility after structure is in place.

Operationally:
\begin{itemize}
  \item sustaining infrastructure must not appear as an actor,
  \item background processes do not enter the foreground,
  \item enabling conditions are not operational objects.
\end{itemize}

COP-15 forbids instrumentalizing the framework itself.

\section{Global Notes}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Caps are Reverse-Inverse (RI).
  \item Caps are not paired as Shadow Axes.
  \item Caps do not license forward or reverse inference.
  \item Caps override all other COP sections.
\end{itemize}

\section{Placement in the COP Corpus}

Caps occupy the outermost structural layer.

They are positioned:
\begin{itemize}
  \item above Operating Paradoxes,
  \item outside Light Axes,
  \item outside Shadow Axes,
  \item and above Extension and Non-Extension Rules.
\end{itemize}

Any conflict is resolved in favor of the Caps.

\section{Use}

Caps are not used.
They are respected.

Foregrounding a Cap indicates misuse.
