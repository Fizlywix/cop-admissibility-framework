\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
This paper introduces no new structure.
It clarifies why multiplicity within the COP framework does not accumulate
into totality.
The transition from one to many is shown to be locally generative but globally
bounded by admissibility.
\end{abstract}

\section{Purpose}

This paper addresses a persistent misinterpretation:
that repeated application of the transition from one to many
produces a total set of possibilities.

It does not.

This paper specifies why VEEL is structurally distinct from ALL,
and why no admissible sequence of operations bridges them.

\section{Multiplicity Without Totality}

Within the COP framework, VEEL denotes multiplicity:
the existence of more than one admissible configuration.

VEEL is not:
\begin{itemize}
  \item completeness,
  \item exhaustiveness,
  \item enumeration,
  \item or total possibility.
\end{itemize}

Multiplicity arises through local differentiation,
not through global accumulation.

\section{Local Generation Constraint}

Each transition from one to many occurs under local constraints.

Every generated configuration:
\begin{itemize}
  \item consumes admissibility,
  \item introduces loss,
  \item and increases structural pressure.
\end{itemize}

No transition is free.
No branching preserves total possibility.

\section{Pruning as a Non-Optional Condition}

Multiplicity requires pruning.

Without pruning:
\begin{itemize}
  \item resource demand diverges,
  \item distinctions lose coherence,
  \item and admissibility collapses.
\end{itemize}

Pruning ensures that VEEL remains bounded.
Accumulation without loss is forbidden.

\section{Why VEEL Cannot Converge to ALL}

ALL denotes unbounded possibility.
VEEL denotes constrained multiplicity.

To converge VEEL into ALL would require:
\begin{itemize}
  \item preservation of all branches,
  \item absence of loss,
  \item and unlimited admissibility.
\end{itemize}

Each requirement violates COP constraints.

The transition is therefore illegitimate.

\section{Illusion of Accumulation}

VEEL may appear to accumulate
when structural similarity is mistaken for preservation.

Repeated forms do not imply retained states.

Structural reuse must not be confused with global accumulation.

\section{Forbidden Totalizations}

The following interpretations are inadmissible:

\begin{itemize}
  \item “everything exists somewhere,”
  \item exhaustive branching models,
  \item total multiverse constructions,
  \item or enumerated possibility spaces.
\end{itemize}

All constitute narrative completion beyond admissibility.

\section{Relation to Saturation}

As VEEL expands, it approaches saturation.

At saturation:
\begin{itemize}
  \item no further branching is admissible,
  \item additional multiplicity forces return,
  \item and totality claims collapse.
\end{itemize}

Saturation enforces the boundary between VEEL and ALL.

\section{Closure}

Multiplicity persists only while bounded.

VEEL does not approach ALL.
It terminates at admissibility.

Any attempt to force accumulation beyond this point
violates the framework.
