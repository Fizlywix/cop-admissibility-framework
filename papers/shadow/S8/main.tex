\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
This Shadow paper documents the terminal admissibility boundary of the COP corpus:
the relation between non-local constraint (forward admissibility)
and unassimilable return (reverse legibility).
It introduces no new structure, notation, or claims.
Its sole purpose is to prevent totalization, narrativization,
and final interpretation of the framework itself.
\end{abstract}

\section{Purpose}

This paper is not a conclusion.
It is a prohibition on conclusions.

S8 binds the terminal Shadow axis:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Forward constraint:} COP-08 (Non-Local Constraint),
  \item \textbf{Reverse constraint:} ICOP-08 (Unassimilable Return).
\end{itemize}

S8 exists to exclude illegitimate moves in which the framework
is treated as complete, total, self-explanatory,
or capable of accounting for its own limits.

\section{What This Paper Is Not}

This paper does not:
\begin{itemize}
  \item summarize the corpus,
  \item unify the preceding papers,
  \item provide a meta-theory,
  \item explain why the framework “works,”
  \item narrativize return or failure,
  \item or license final interpretation.
\end{itemize}

Any reading that treats S8 as closure, explanation,
or metaphysical claim is invalid.

\section{Shadow Axis S8}

\subsection{Forward: COP-08 Non-Local Constraint}

Non-local constraint constrains forward admissibility
after all structural coordination has been exhausted.

COP-08 does not act.
It does not appear.
It does not participate in structure.

Operationally:
\begin{itemize}
  \item no further articulation is admissible,
  \item no additional representation is permitted,
  \item no agent or mechanism may be introduced,
  \item constraint persists without localization.
\end{itemize}

COP-08 forbids totalization of the framework
and forbids narrating its own limits.

\subsection{Reverse: ICOP-08 Unassimilable Return}

ICOP-08 constrains reverse legibility
when no admissible local routing remains.

Return does not appear as resolution, collapse, or exit.
Instead, \texttt{--} appears:
\begin{itemize}
  \item non-local,
  \item unassimilable,
  \item non-narrativizable,
  \item without agent or destination.
\end{itemize}

The configuration \texttt{--} is not a state,
not a sink,
and not an outcome.

It is unassimilable return.

\subsection{The Boundary}

The boundary enforced by S8 is the following:

\begin{quote}
\textbf{What constrains articulation must not appear within it.} \\
\textbf{What returns beyond structure must not be narrated.}
\end{quote}

Foregrounding constraint produces totalization.
Narrating return produces ideology.

\section{Local \texttt{+} and Non-Local \texttt{--}}

\subsection{Local phenomenology}

Forward use of the corpus proceeds only along \texttt{+} branches:
what appears is what is locally admissible and operable.

Neither non-local constraint nor unassimilable return
is locally experienced or traversed.

\subsection{Non-local return}

When admissible routing fails across all local bands,
return does not register as an event.

Instead, \texttt{--} becomes detectable:
not as content,
but as absence of further admissible articulation.

This detection licenses no explanation.

\section{Illegitimate Moves (Forbidden Inferences)}

S8 forbids the following moves:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Framework totalization:}
  treating the COP corpus as a complete or closed theory.
  \item \textbf{Meta-explanation:}
  explaining why the framework itself must be true.
  \item \textbf{Constraint narrativization:}
  turning limits into stories, purposes, or destinies.
  \item \textbf{Return localization:}
  treating \texttt{--} as a state, sink, or mechanism.
  \item \textbf{Final synthesis:}
  attempting to close the corpus with a unifying claim.
\end{enumerate}

These moves collapse constraint into ideology.

\section{Detection Signals}

S8 becomes visible only under stress, through:

\begin{itemize}
  \item demands for a final explanation,
  \item questions about ultimate purpose or destiny,
  \item attempts to localize or explain \texttt{--},
  \item narrative wrapping of return,
  \item interpretive paralysis following totalization.
\end{itemize}

These signals indicate boundary violation,
not incompleteness.

\section{Stop Conditions}

Correct use stops at the boundary.

\begin{itemize}
  \item If the framework is being totalized, stop (COP-08).
  \item If return is being localized or narrated, stop (ICOP-08).
  \item If closure is demanded, stop.
\end{itemize}

S8 does not conclude the corpus.
It prevents conclusion.

\section{Figures (Constraint Objects)}

Figures in Shadow papers are constraint markers only.
They do not explain, illustrate, or unify.

\section{Conclusion}

S8 enforces a single discipline:
do not narrate what functions only by remaining unarticulated.

Nothing further is added.
