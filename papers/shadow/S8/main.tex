\title{S8: Non-Local Constraint and Unassimilable Return}
\author{Pascal Sparidaens}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
This Shadow paper documents the terminal admissibility boundary of the COP corpus:
the relation between pre-structural null dominance
and post-structural non-local constraint.
It introduces no new structure, notation, or claims.
Its sole purpose is to prevent totalization, narrativization,
and final interpretation of the framework itself.
\end{abstract}

\section{Purpose}

This paper is not a conclusion.
It is a prohibition on conclusions.

S8 binds the terminal Shadow axis:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Pre-structural constraint:} COP-00 (Null Dominance),
  \item \textbf{Post-structural constraint:} COP-08 (Non-Local Constraint).
\end{itemize}

S8 exists to exclude illegitimate moves in which the framework
is treated as complete, total, self-explanatory,
or capable of accounting for its own limits.

\section{What This Paper Is Not}

This paper does not:
\begin{itemize}
  \item summarize the corpus,
  \item unify the preceding papers,
  \item provide a meta-theory,
  \item explain why the framework “works,”
  \item narrativize return or failure,
  \item or license final interpretation.
\end{itemize}

Any reading that treats S8 as closure, explanation,
or metaphysical claim is invalid.

\section{Shadow Axis S8}

\subsection{Pre-Structural: COP-00 (Null Dominance)}

Null dominance constrains admissibility before any structure appears:
what functions correctly is not foregrounded.

Operationally:
\begin{itemize}
  \item absence of signal is admissible,
  \item silence does not require explanation,
  \item correct operation leaves no trace.
\end{itemize}

Null dominance forbids the assumption
that visibility implies importance
or that absence implies hidden causation.

\subsection{Post-Structural: COP-08 (Non-Local Constraint)}

Non-local constraint constrains admissibility
after structural saturation is reached.

COP-08 does not act.
It does not appear.
It does not participate in structure.

Operationally:
\begin{itemize}
  \item no further articulation is admissible,
  \item no additional representation is permitted,
  \item no agent or mechanism may be introduced,
  \item constraint persists without localization.
\end{itemize}

COP-08 forbids instrumentalization of the framework
and forbids narrating its limits.

\subsection{The Boundary}

The boundary enforced by S8 is the following:

\begin{quote}
\textbf{What enables operation must not dominate it.} \\
\textbf{What constrains articulation must not appear within it.}
\end{quote}

Foregrounding null dominance produces mystification.
Foregrounding non-local constraint produces totalization.

\section{Local \texttt{+} and Non-Local \texttt{--}}

\subsection{Local phenomenology}

Forward use of the corpus proceeds only along \texttt{+} branches:
what appears is what is locally admissible and operable.

Neither null dominance nor non-local constraint
is locally experienced or traversed.

\subsection{Non-local return (ICOP-08)}

When admissible routing fails across all local bands,
return does not appear as resolution or collapse.

Instead, \texttt{--} appears:
\begin{itemize}
  \item non-local,
  \item unassimilable,
  \item non-narrativizable,
  \item without agent or destination.
\end{itemize}

The configuration \texttt{--} is not a state,
not a sink,
and not an outcome.

It is \textbf{unassimilable return} (ICOP-08).

\section{Illegitimate Moves (Forbidden Inferences)}

S8 forbids the following moves:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Framework totalization:}
  treating the COP corpus as a complete or closed theory.
  \item \textbf{Meta-explanation:}
  explaining why the framework itself must be true.
  \item \textbf{Constraint narrativization:}
  turning limits into stories, purposes, or destinies.
  \item \textbf{Background actorization:}
  treating non-local constraint as an agent or force.
  \item \textbf{Mystical completion:}
  attributing meaning to what is structurally forbidden.
\end{enumerate}

These moves collapse constraint into ideology.

\section{Detection Signals}

S8 becomes visible only under stress, through:

\begin{itemize}
  \item demands for a final explanation,
  \item questions about ultimate purpose or destiny,
  \item attempts to localize or explain \texttt{--},
  \item narrative wrapping of return,
  \item interpretive paralysis following totalization.
\end{itemize}

These signals indicate boundary violation,
not incompleteness.

\section{Stop Conditions}

Correct use stops at the boundary.

\begin{itemize}
  \item If the framework is being explained, stop (COP-00).
  \item If the framework is being treated as an object or agent, stop (COP-08).
  \item If return is being narrativized, stop (ICOP-08).
\end{itemize}

S8 does not conclude the corpus.
It prevents conclusion.

\section{Figures (Constraint Objects)}

Figures in Shadow papers are constraint markers only.
They do not explain, illustrate, or unify.

\section{Conclusion}

S8 enforces a single discipline:
do not narrate what functions only by remaining unarticulated.

Nothing further is added.
