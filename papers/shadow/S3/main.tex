\title{S3: Coherence and Maintenance}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
This Shadow paper documents a single admissibility boundary:
the tension between coherence without communication (forward admissibility)
and maintenance versus history (reverse legibility).
It introduces no new structure, notation, or claims.
Its sole purpose is to prevent the collapse of structural coherence
into coordination, narration, or historical reconstruction.
\end{abstract}

\section{Purpose}

This paper is not a contribution.
It is a constraint marker.

S3 binds one Shadow axis:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Forward constraint:} COP-03 (Coherence Without Communication),
  \item \textbf{Reverse constraint:} ICOP-03 (Maintenance Is Cyclic; History Is Directional).
\end{itemize}

S3 exists to exclude illegitimate moves that arise when coherence is treated
as a product of communication, or when maintenance is treated as recoverable history.

\section{What This Paper Is Not}

This paper does not:
\begin{itemize}
  \item explain coordination mechanisms,
  \item prescribe communication protocols,
  \item reconstruct historical states,
  \item justify present structure by past intent,
  \item or narrate continuity.
\end{itemize}

Any reading that turns S3 into an account of how coherence is achieved is invalid.

\section{Shadow Axis S3}

\subsection{Forward: COP-03 Coherence Without Communication}

Coherence without communication constrains forward admissibility:
structural alignment may persist without signaling, agreement, or exchange.

Operationally:
\begin{itemize}
  \item coherence is admissible without messaging,
  \item alignment is enforced by constraint, not consensus,
  \item silence is not evidence of failure.
\end{itemize}

Coherence is not produced.
It is sustained by shared limits.

\subsection{Reverse: ICOP-03 Maintenance and History}

ICOP-03 constrains reverse legibility:
maintenance is cyclic and admissible;
history is directional and not recoverable.

Operationally:
\begin{itemize}
  \item upkeep does not encode origin,
  \item repetition does not preserve state,
  \item historical reconstruction is illegitimate.
\end{itemize}

Reverse reading may detect degradation,
but may not infer original configuration.

\subsection{The Boundary}

The boundary enforced by S3 is the following:

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Coherence does not imply communication.} \\
\textbf{Maintenance does not imply recoverable history.}
\end{quote}

Attempts to explain coherence via signaling
collapse constraint into coordination.
Attempts to recover history from maintenance
replace admissibility with narrative continuity.

\section{Local \texttt{+} and Non-Local Constraint}

\subsection{Local phenomenology}

Forward operation proceeds only along \texttt{+} branches:
what manifests is sustained coherence under constraint.
Local silence is admissible and does not demand explanation.

\subsection{Non-local diagnosability}

Failure of coherence is not locally experienced.
It becomes detectable only non-locally, under accumulated pressure,
as forced synchronization, archival obsession, or origin narratives.

Such signals are diagnostic only.
They are not events and must not be narrated.

\section{Illegitimate Moves (Forbidden Inferences)}

S3 forbids the following moves:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Communication requirement:}
  treating coherence as evidence of signaling or agreement.
  \item \textbf{Consensus projection:}
  inferring shared understanding from structural alignment.
  \item \textbf{Historical recovery:}
  attempting to reconstruct original states from maintenance activity.
  \item \textbf{Origin fixation:}
  treating beginnings as explanatory anchors.
  \item \textbf{Silence pathologization:}
  interpreting absence of communication as malfunction.
\end{enumerate}

These moves replace constraint coherence
with social or narrative explanation.

\section{Detection Signals}

S3 becomes visible under stress through:

\begin{itemize}
  \item growth of coordination overhead,
  \item introduction of mandatory signaling,
  \item increasing reference to “how it was meant to be,”
  \item audits replacing constraint checks,
  \item confusion between upkeep and origin.
\end{itemize}

These signals indicate boundary pressure, not loss of coherence.

\section{Stop Conditions}

Correct use stops at the boundary.

\begin{itemize}
  \item If coherence is being explained via communication, stop (COP-03).
  \item If maintenance is used to reconstruct history, stop (ICOP-03).
  \item If silence is treated as error, stop.
\end{itemize}

S3 does not restore origins.
It prevents illegitimate inference.

\section{Figures (Constraint Objects)}

Figures in Shadow papers are constraint markers only.
They do not explain or illustrate processes.

\section{Conclusion}

S3 exists to enforce a single discipline:
coherence without communication,
and maintenance without historical recovery.

Nothing further is added.
